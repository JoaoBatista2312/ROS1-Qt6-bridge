# ROS1-Qt6-bridge

Simple ROS node to send information to a Qt GUI using a ROS bridge.

This program runs on a single thread.

To run: rosrun qt6_ros ros_qml_integration.py

Note: this still needs some changes to support more complex programs, such as camera vizualization and continuous output GUIs. This will still be updated.
